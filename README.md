# Topic-Modeling-Project

## **Problem Statement:**
In the era of information overload, categorizing news articles into distinct clusters based on their underlying topics or themes is crucial for efficient information retrieval and analysis. This project aims to leverage topic modeling techniques to categorize news articles into different clusters based on the topics or themes articulated within them. Each text or sentence in a document is inherently associated with a topic or theme, and by identifying these latent topics, we can enhance our understanding of the content and structure of news articles.

## **Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to utilize topic modeling techniques to categorize news articles into distinct clusters based on their underlying topics or themes. By employing techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and BERT-Topic, we aim to extract meaningful topics from the news articles and facilitate their categorization into relevant clusters. This exploration will enable us to uncover relationships and distributions between words associated with various topics, including potentially identifying patterns indicative of fake news.

## **Methodology:**
Our exploration focuses on employing various topic modeling techniques to achieve the objective of categorizing news articles into different clusters. The methodologies include:

1. **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):**
   LDA is a probabilistic topic modeling technique that represents documents as mixtures of topics. By iteratively assigning words to topics and documents to distributions over topics, LDA discovers latent topics within the corpus and categorizes documents based on these topics.

2. **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF):**
   NMF is a matrix factorization technique that decomposes a matrix into two non-negative matrices. In the context of topic modeling, NMF extracts latent topics from the term-document matrix, where each document is represented as a weighted combination of topics.

3. **BERT-Topic:**
   BERT-Topic is a recent approach that combines BERT embeddings with topic modeling techniques. By leveraging pre-trained BERT models, BERT-Topic captures contextual information from the news articles and generates topic representations, enabling effective categorization and clustering.

By applying these topic modeling techniques, we aim to uncover meaningful topics within the news articles and categorize them into distinct clusters. This exploration will provide valuable insights into the content and structure of news articles, potentially revealing patterns indicative of fake news and enhancing our understanding of the underlying topics and themes prevalent in the news media.
